# Relay Funder

**Community-driven crowdfunding infrastructure for refugee and displaced communities**

## Our Mission

Relay Funder is building infrastructure to empower displaced community leaders to fund projects they know will work‚Äîbacked by supporters worldwide and amplified through sponsor-seeded matching pools. We are developing dignified, transparent funding systems that put agency and leadership at the center of humanitarian support.

## Design Principles

**üéØ Leadership Driven** - Local leaders propose and manage projects based on deep community knowledge and existing trust networks.

**‚ö° Amplified Impact** - Sponsor-seeded matching pools multiply individual contributions, turning community support into collective momentum.
